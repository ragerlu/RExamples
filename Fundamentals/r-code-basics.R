#Arithmetic: Operations based on arithmetic mathematic logic such as addition or subtraction.

#Subtraction: 
1-1
#[0]

#Division:
2/1
#[2]

#Multiplication:

#Boolean: A logical data type that can have only the values true or false. Involving this
#logic data type there is logic to be learned.

#Boolean Values:
true
false
#Now true can never equal false and false can never equal true. Think of these as a 
#1 and a 0.

#Logic operations for boolean evaluations:
#Greater than:
>
#Less than:
<
#Greater than or equal to:
>=
#Less than or equal to:
<=
#Equal to:
==
#Not equal to:
!=
#And (Both):
and 
&&
#Or (Both):
or
||

#Examples of boolean operations are:
true != false
#[true]
5>3
#[true]
true == false
#[false]
