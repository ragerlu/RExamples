VECTORIZED CODE
Vectored code in R is easy to write due to R functions already being vectorized. If you base your code 
around the functions you wish to use, then your code will easily be made vectorized. 

To create vectorized code:

1. Use vectorized functions to complete the sequential steps in your program. 
2. Use logical subsetting to handle parallel cases. Try to manipulate every element in a case at once.

FAST FOR LOOPS
The speed of your for loops can be dramatically increased by optimizing loops. First you want remove as
much code as you can from the loop. preferably the loop has as minimal code as possible within its scope.
For instance if a line of code only needs to be run once it should be outside the loop. Second, ensure 
that any storage objects you use with the loop are large enough to contain all of the results of the loop.

*The efficiency of your code can be checked using the system.time() function which returns the time it
which your system takes to run your code involving the user, the system and the total elapsed time.
